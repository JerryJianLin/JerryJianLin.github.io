<b>Fig.</b> Current–voltage (<i>I-V</i>) curves of planar and trench MIS TDs with different equivalent oxide thicknesses (EOTs) and two voltage sweeping directions (solid: sweep forward, dash: sweep backward). <br/>
* For Trench MIS TDs, when EOT increases: <br/>
  * more apparent hysteresis. <br/>
  * stronger transient current <br/>

<b>Fig.</b> Trench structure metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) tunnel diodes (TDs) have more electron traps in the trench structure compared to normal planar structure MIS TDs, which is the reason for the enhanced memory properties in trench MIS TDs. Left: the read process after reset voltage stress (-1.5V 120s then -1.75V 20s). Right: the read process after set voltage stress (+1V 20s).

**Abstract:** <br/>
In this article, the influence of various oxide thicknesses on the transient current behavior of trench structure metal insulator semiconductor (MIS) tunnel diodes (TDs) was examined. By current voltage (I V), retention measurements, and Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) simulation, we found that the magnitude of the transient current relates to the number of excess electrons.
