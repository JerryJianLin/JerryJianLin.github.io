<b>Fig.</b> Trench structure metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) tunnel diodes (TDs) have more electron traps in the trench structure compared to normal planar structure MIS TDs (Planar MIS), which is the reason for the enhanced memory properties in trench MIS TDs. Left: the read process after reset voltage stress (-1.5V 120s then -1.75V 20s). Right: the read process after set voltage stress (+1V 20s).

* <b>Utilize the extra traps in the trench structure of Trench MIS TDs: </b>
  * <b>Can store more charges in the dielectric.</b>
  * <b>Largely influence the tunneling current in Trench MIS.</b>
  * <b>Result in better memory properties (e.g., current window) in Trench MIS than in Planar MIS.</b>

**Abstract:** <br/>
A new type of MIS TD memory with trench structure is proposed. The memory properties of MIS TD with trench structure are investigated by current-voltage and memory endurance measurement. It is found that the trench MIS TDs exhibit better memory properties, e.g., larger current difference between reset and set states, compared with conventional planar structure MIS TDs. With the improved memory properties, trench MIS TD may find its use in embedded memory.
