* In the first part of this page, I would introduce some background about the semiconductor devices, MIS TDs.
* Second part is my research works about "Trench Structure MIS TDs".

---

## 1. Basics of MIS TDs
---
* Device Structure



## 2. My research: Trench Structure MIS TDs (Trench MIS TDs) 
---
* In 2019, with the aim to utilize MIS TDs as a new type of memory devices, I proposed a new device structure for MIS TDs.
* I called it <b>"Trench structure MIS TD (Trench MIS TD)"</b>. \[One can see the following figure\] <br/>

* The following is my research about Trench MIS TDs.
