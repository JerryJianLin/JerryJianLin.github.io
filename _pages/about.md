Welcome! <br> My name is Jian-Yu (Jerry) Lin, a graduate research assistant at the [Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering at National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://giee.ntu.edu.tw/en/index.php). <br/>
I received my B.S. degree in [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php) in 2019 and M.S. degree in [Electronics Engineering](https://giee.ntu.edu.tw/en/index.php) in 2021 both from NTU. <br/>
<br/>
I have worked with [Prof. Jenn-Gwo Hwu](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?teacher_id=901074) since 2018 and investigated the transient current behavior of metal-insulator-semiconductor tunnel diodes (MIS TDs). <br/>
We aim to utilize MIS TDs as memory devices using their transient current behavior.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Currently, I am applying for PhD programs.<br/> 
<br/>
<br/>
My research interests include:
* Semiconductor Physics and Devices
* Emerging Memory Devices (such as resistive random access memory (RRAM), phase change memory (PCM), and ferroelectric memory)
* Low Dimensional Materials & Devices 
* Power Semiconductor Devices
* Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) Devices
* Transistors <br/>
<br/>
