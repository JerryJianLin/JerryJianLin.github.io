Welcome! <br> 
<br>
My name is Jian-Yu (Jerry) Lin, a graduate research assistant at the [Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering at National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://giee.ntu.edu.tw/en/index.php). <br/>
I received my B.S. degree in [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php) in 2019 and M.S. degree in [Electronics Engineering](https://giee.ntu.edu.tw/en/index.php) in 2021 both from NTU. <br/>
I have worked with [Prof. Jenn-Gwo Hwu](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?teacher_id=901074) since 2018 and investigated the transient current behavior of metal-insulator-semiconductor tunnel diodes (MIS TDs).
